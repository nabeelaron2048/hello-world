# hello-world
only for testing purpose
i like harley davidson bikes
favorite is 883R

i like many things now 
im having difficulties in living the life i wanted 
im facing hard decisions to make ,
i cant find love, even if i did the other dont want to be with me, i fear dying alone.
my brain is a mess, cant think properly , may be because lack of sleep or too much television or i dont know what it is . i need to find purpose in live, i feel like im loosing the touch with reality.
